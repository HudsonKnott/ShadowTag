# ShadowTag
A Minecraft minigame. The idea is, when the game starts someone becomes the tagger and they are frozen for 30 seconds.
Once the tagger is unfrozen, they can tag people. 

<!--Once someone is tagged, they become the tagger and are frozen for 30 seconds. The game keeps going until you end it.
The tagger also has powerups. A rabbit's foot for jump boost, a feather for swiftness, and gray dye for invisibility.-->

## Commands:
* /shadowtag start <player>
  * Sets the tagger and starts the game
  * Permission: st.start
* /shadowtag end
  * Ends the game
  * Permission: st.end
