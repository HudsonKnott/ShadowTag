# ShadowTag
A Minecraft minigame. The idea is, when the game starts someone becomes the tagger and they are frozen for 30 seconds.
Once the tagger is unfrozen, they can tag people. Once someone is tagged, they become the tagger and are frozen for 30 seconds. The game keeps going until you end it.

## Commands:
* /shadowtagger <player>
  * Sets the tagger and starts the game
  * Permission: st.start
* /shadowend
  * Ends the game
  * Permission: st.end
